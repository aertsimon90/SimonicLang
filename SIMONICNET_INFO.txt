SimonicNet, is a web hosting service, but this web platform is completely virtual and easily accessible only with SimonicLang. This web platform enables everyone to create servers that can be used for free and until the platform closes and to interact with the servers. SimonicLang documentation describes how to use it and which commands to use. If you want to run SimonicNet in a different environment from SimonicLang in your own Python code, you can do the following:
- Open the "simlang.py" file in the SimonicLang package, which is the main file of simoniclang.
- Find the SimonicNet class in the file and copy all of its content.
- Then, you can manage your own service using the SimonicNet class in your own Python code.

Additionally, SimonicNet is a world wide web server and users create their own servers within the server. If you ask where this server is, it is located at simonserver.pythonanywhere.com and all operations are run from the /wwwCommand path, using the Command header and Content header while doing so. If you have created your own SimonicNet server, but when you open the server with the SimonicNet.Open command, you encounter "<h1> Empty Source </h1>", and if you want to change this content, edit the "main" file with the SimonicNet.SetOpenFile command. This file is the most open file for access and is automatically accessed with the Open command.
