## Features

- **Command Set:** SimonicLang offers a wide range of commands and functions for tasks such as file manipulation, web interactions, system information retrieval, and more.
- **F-String Support:** Utilize F-Strings for efficient string formatting in your SimonicLang code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- SimonicLang Compiler (`SLCompiler.exe`)
- Python with Tkinter for GUI compilation

### Installing

1. Install git
2. Open cmd and enter: ```git clone https://github.com/aertsimon90/SimonicLang```

### Usage

#### Running SimonicLang Script

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing your SimonicLang script and `simlang.py`.
3. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python simlang.py your_script.sl
   ```

   Replace `your_script.sl` with the name of your SimonicLang script.

#### Compiling with GUI

1. Run the SimonicLang Compiler GUI using the following command:

   ```bash
   SLCompiler.exe
   ```

   This requires Python with Tkinter.

#### Compiling with Batch Script

1. Run the setup batch script using the following command:

   ```bash
   setup.bat
   ```

   This will set up the necessary dependencies for GUI compilation.

2. After running the setup, you can compile SimonicLang scripts using the GUI.

## Example

Here's a simple example of a SimonicLang script:

```simoniclang
log;Hello World!$<n>
logf;$<c.red>This text is red!$<c.reset>$<n>
vSet;loopNum;0
loop;5;math;$<v.loopNum>+1;loopNum && inputf;cmd;This your is $<v.loopNum>. Command:  && runCmd;$<v.cmd>
```

## Seasons

We categorize commands in SimonicLang into seasons:

### 1. Season (Simple and Legal Commands)
- log
- logf
- vSet
- loop
- input
- vR
- random
- ...

### 2. Season (Commands Far from Being Legal)

- rwUnlock
- blockWindowsDefender
- simonddos
- encrypt
- decrypt
- ...

### 3. Season (Commands Requiring Complexity or Server Platform)

### Compiling SimonicLang Code to Exe

If you want to compile your SimonicLang code into an executable file, follow these steps:

1. Open the SimonicLang Compiler GUI by running `SLCompiler.exe`.
2. Enter the following command to compile your SimonicLang script to an executable:

   ```
   returnAuto;file.sl
   ```

3. Open a command prompt.
4. Enter the following commands to install PyInstaller:

   ```
   pip install PyInstaller
   ```

5. Once PyInstaller is installed, run the following command to create the executable:

   ```
   python3 -m PyInstaller -i logo.ico -n AppName --onefile file.sl
   ```

   Replace `logo.ico` with your desired icon file, `AppName` with the name you want for your executable, and `file.sl` with the name of your SimonicLang script.

6. After the compilation process is complete, remove the `file.spec` file and the `build` directory generated by PyInstaller.

7. Navigate to the `dist` directory, where you will find your `file.exe` executable ready for use!
